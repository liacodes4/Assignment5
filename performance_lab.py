# Output: 3

Time and Space Analysis for problem 4:
- When do resizes happen?  Every time the list reaches its current capacity.
- What is the worst-case for a single append? O(n) when resizing and copying to a new list.

- Space complexity: 0(n)
- Why does doubling reduce the cost overall? Because it keeps the number of resizes small,
  spreading out the expensive copy steps over many cheap ones.
